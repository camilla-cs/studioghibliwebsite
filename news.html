        <h2>Updates from the Ghibli Community! üèπ‚òÅÔ∏èüíå </h2>

        <h4>The Boy and the Heron</h4>
        <p>"The Boy and the Heron" is the last installment from Studio Ghibli's creative genius and founder Hayao Miyazaki. 
            <br>
            It narrates the story of a young boy, Mahito, who after losing his mother in a tragic incident, travels to a magical kingdom <br>
            with the guidance of a heron as he tries to find his place in an unforgiving world. 
            <br>
            The movie came out in Japan's theathers in the summer of 2023 and even though it was a blatantly success, many viewers and fans were left skeptical of the story's meaning, 
            almost as saying that it wasn't "ghibli-like" as the previous movies. 
            <br>
            It was a "different" movie, for sure. There was no cutesy stuff and boy that would make turn heads (like Howl for example), and I feel like this was Miyazaki's intention all along, 
            like a sort of statement that some thought it was a final goodbye to his legacy as director. 
            Is it though? 
            <br> 
            Miyazaki is funnily famous in the animation community for saying that each movie he makes would be the last. But as he said at the end of the documentary "Hayao and the Heron"
            (which I recommend watching), he tells the viewer that he makes movies for the loved ones he lost through the years. 
            <br>
            He feels the weight of the words people told him before passing, and as shadows (or spirits as he refers) they loom over him in his wake.
