            Ghibli founder's perspective on AI
        </h4>
        <p>Over the past few weeks, ChatGPT's latest feature, the Ghibli-style photo transformation, has been all the rage on social media apps. 
            While the latter has been fervently welcomed by the masses, the same cannot be said for the huge community of artists and fans of Ghibli work.
            In fact, so much criticism has been levelled at those using the latter feature in editing photos that ChatGPT has discontinued the possibility of using the functionality.
            <br>
            <img src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miyazaki-ai-slop.jpg" style="max-width: 40%; margin-left:1em;">
            <br>
            Many reported the Studio Ghibli founder's words from an old interview on AI: "I am utterly disgusted." Miyazaki says. "I strongly feel this is an insult to life itself."
            These strong words are a response to a demonstration made by a group of animators and designers that presented to Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki (Studio Ghibli producer) their creation of an AI machine that can animate images. <br>
            The presentation showed an image that could move on its own, but its unnatural and "zombie-like" movements reminded Miyazaki of a friend's health struggle, which he didn't find entertaining.

        <h4 style="font-family: 'DotGothic16', sans-serif;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;">The Boy and the Heron</h4>
        <p>"The Boy and the Heron" is the last installment from Studio Ghibli's creative genius and founder Hayao Miyazaki. 
            <br>
            It narrates the story of a young boy, Mahito, who after losing his mother in a tragic incident, travels to a magical kingdom <br>
            with the guidance of a heron as he tries to find his place in an unforgiving world. 

            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2b/6e/1c/2b6e1cba91e541435ac94c5410ae3f72.jpg" style="max-width: 80%; margin-left:1em;">
            <br>
            The movie came out in Japan's theathers in the summer of 2023 and even though it was a blatantly success, many viewers and fans were left skeptical of the story's meaning, 
            almost as saying that it wasn't "ghibli-like" as the previous movies. 
            <br>
            It was a "different" movie, for sure. There was no cutesy stuff and boy that would make turn heads (like Howl for example), and I feel like this was Miyazaki's intention all along, 
            like a sort of statement. Some even thought it was a final goodbye to his legacy as director. 
            Is it though? 
            <br> 
            Miyazaki is jokingly famous for saying that each movie he makes would be the last. But as he said at the end of the documentary "Hayao and the Heron"
            (which I recommend watching), he tells the viewer that he makes movies for the loved ones he lost through the years. 
            <br>
            He feels the weight of the words people told him before passing, and as shadows (or 'spirits' as he refers) they loom over him in his wake. 
            <br>

            <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3829d01dcb591480ab3f8f4be1195d63/9cd394ee6d1ad57b-66/s540x810/b86ed08e09e6b70e2d12c5537c60c852a7e5ec99.gif" style="max-width: 80%; margin: 1em;">

            <br>
            The Boy and the Heron explores themes of loss, self-acceptance, and moving forward. The story follows Mahito, a boy who endures a traumatic experience‚Äîthe devastating fire that destroyed Tokyo and took his mother‚Äôs life. Forced to leave his home, he moves in with his father and his pregnant new wife, who bears an uncanny resemblance to his late mother. At school, he faces bullying, further deepening his sense of isolation.
            <br>
            One particularly striking scene shows Mahito, after a fight with his classmates, picking up a rock and smashing it against his own head. This moment could symbolize his need to feel something‚Äîperhaps an attempt to break through his emotional numbness. Throughout the first part of the film, Mahito carries himself with a stoic demeanor, almost like a soldier‚Äîa mindset that was widely encouraged during World War II. Even after hurting himself, he remains composed, walking home as if nothing had happened.
            <br>
            By the end of the film, however, Mahito undergoes a transformation. He becomes more at peace with himself, no longer suppressing his emotions, and finds a renewed willingness to embrace life.
